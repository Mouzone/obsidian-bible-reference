Fork of [obsidian-bible-reference](https://github.com/tim-hub/obsidian-bible-reference) with minor stylistic improvements for rendering bottom reference

# Todo
- Add a new class for adding local bible xml versions to selections
- Would allow the plugin to parse a folder and add the available options
- Flow would be: user creates a folder, and links the folder in the plugin, then reads it probably through a .env and adds them as options to obsidian
